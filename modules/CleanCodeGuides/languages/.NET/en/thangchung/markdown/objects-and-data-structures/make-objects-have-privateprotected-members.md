## Objects and Data Structures

## Make objects have private/protected members

**Bad:**

```csharp
class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}

var employee = new Employee("John Doe");
Console.WriteLine(employee.Name); // Employee name: John Doe
```

**Good:**

```csharp
class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; }

    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}

var employee = new Employee("John Doe");
Console.WriteLine(employee.Name); // Employee name: John Doe
```
