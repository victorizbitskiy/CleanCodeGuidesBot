## Objects and Data Structures

### Use getters and setters

In C# / VB.NET you can set `public`, `protected` and `private` keywords for methods.
Using it, you can control properties modification on an object.

- When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
- Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
- Encapsulates the internal representation.
- Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
- Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality.
- You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a server.

Additionally, this is part of Open/Closed principle, from object-oriented design principles.

**Bad:**

```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    public double Balance = 1000;
}

var bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Fake buy shoes...
bankAccount.Balance -= 100;
```

**Good:**

```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    private double _balance = 0.0D;

    pubic double Balance {
        get {
            return _balance;
        }
    }

    public BankAccount(balance = 1000)
    {
       _balance = balance;
    }

    public void WithdrawBalance(int amount)
    {
        if (amount > _balance)
        {
            throw new Exception('Amount greater than available balance.');
        }

        _balance -= amount;
    }

    public void DepositBalance(int amount)
    {
        _balance += amount;
    }
}

var bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
bankAccount.WithdrawBalance(price);

// Get balance
balance = bankAccount.Balance;
```
