## Variables

### Use searchable names \(part 1\)

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers. Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**

```csharp
// What the heck is data for?
var data = new { Name = "John", Age = 42 };

var stream1 = new MemoryStream();
var ser1 = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(object));
ser1.WriteObject(stream1, data);

stream1.Position = 0;
var sr1 = new StreamReader(stream1);
Console.Write("JSON form of Data object: ");
Console.WriteLine(sr1.ReadToEnd());
```

**Good:**

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
    Name = "John",
    Age = 42
};

var stream2 = new MemoryStream();
var ser2 = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Person));
ser2.WriteObject(stream2, data);

stream2.Position = 0;
var sr2 = new StreamReader(stream2);
Console.Write("JSON form of Data object: ");
Console.WriteLine(sr2.ReadToEnd());
```
