### Avoid magic string

Magic strings are string values that are specified directly within application code that have an impact on the applicationâ€™s behavior. Frequently, such strings will end up being duplicated within the system, and since they cannot automatically be updated using refactoring tools, they become a common source of bugs when changes are made to some strings but not others.

**Bad**

```csharp
if (userRole == "Admin")
{
    // logic in here
}
```

**Good**

```csharp
const string ADMIN_ROLE = "Admin"
if (userRole == ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    // logic in here
}
```

Using this we only have to change in centralize place and others will adapt it.
