### Avoid magic string

Magic strings are string values that are specified directly within application code that have an impact on the application’s behavior. Frequently, such strings will end up being duplicated within the system, and since they cannot automatically be updated using refactoring tools, they become a common source of bugs when changes are made to some strings but not others.

**Bad**

```csharp
if (userRole == "Admin")
{
    // logic in here
}
```

**Good**

```csharp
const string ADMIN_ROLE = "Admin"
if (userRole == ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    // logic in here
}
```

Using this we only have to change in centralize place and others will adapt it.
