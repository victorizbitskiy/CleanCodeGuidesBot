## Functions

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much
cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```csharp
public void SendEmailToListOfClients(string[] clients)
{
    foreach (var client in clients)
    {
        var clientRecord = db.Find(client);
        if (clientRecord.IsActive())
        {
            Email(client);
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```csharp
public void SendEmailToListOfClients(string[] clients)
{
    var activeClients = GetActiveClients(clients);
    // Do some logic
}

public List<Client> GetActiveClients(string[] clients)
{
    return db.Find(clients).Where(s => s.Status == "Active");
}
```
