### Prefer composition over inheritance

As stated famously in [_Design Patterns_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.

The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some cases it can.

You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance makes more sense than composition:

1. Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a" relationship \(Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails\).
2. You can reuse code from the base classes \(Humans can move like all animals\).
3. You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class \(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move\).

**Bad:**

```csharp
class Employee
{
    private string Name { get; set; }
    private string Email { get; set; }

    public Employee(string name, string email)
    {
        Name = name;
        Email = email;
    }

    // ...
}

// Bad because Employees "have" tax data.
// EmployeeTaxData is not a type of Employee

class EmployeeTaxData : Employee
{
    private string Name { get; }
    private string Email { get; }

    public EmployeeTaxData(string name, string email, string ssn, string salary)
    {
         // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```csharp
class EmployeeTaxData
{
    public string Ssn { get; }
    public string Salary { get; }

    public EmployeeTaxData(string ssn, string salary)
    {
        Ssn = ssn;
        Salary = salary;
    }

    // ...
}

class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public string Email { get; }
    public EmployeeTaxData TaxData { get; }

    public Employee(string name, string email)
    {
        Name = name;
        Email = email;
    }

    public void SetTax(string ssn, double salary)
    {
        TaxData = new EmployeeTaxData(ssn, salary);
    }

    // ...
}
```
