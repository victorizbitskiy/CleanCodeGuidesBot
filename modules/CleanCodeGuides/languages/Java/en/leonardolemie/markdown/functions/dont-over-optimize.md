### Don't over-optimize

Modern browsers do a lot of optimization under-the-hood at runtime. A lot of times, if you are optimizing then you are just wasting your time. [There are good resources](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers) for seeing where optimization is lacking. Target those in the meantime, until they are fixed if they can be.
