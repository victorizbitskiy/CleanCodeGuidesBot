## **Functions**
### Functions should do one thing  

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**
```java
public void emailClients(List<Client> clients) {
    for (Client client : clients) {
        Client clientRecord = repository.findOne(client.getId());
        if (clientRecord.isActive()){
            email(client);
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**
```java
public void emailClients(List<Client> clients) {
    for (Client client : clients) {
        if (isActiveClient(client)) {
            email(client);
        }
    }
}

private boolean isActiveClient(Client client) {
    Client clientRecord = repository.findOne(client.getId());
    return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```
