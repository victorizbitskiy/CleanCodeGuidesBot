### Async/Await are even cleaner than Promises

Promises are a very clean alternative to callbacks, but ES2017/ES8 brings async and await
which offer an even cleaner solution. All you need is a function that is prefixed
in an `async` keyword, and then you can write your logic imperatively without
a `then` chain of functions. Use this if you can take advantage of ES2017/ES8 features
today!  

**Bad:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request-promise";
import { writeFile } from "fs-extra";

get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin")
  .then(body => {
    return writeFile("article.html", body);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("File written");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

**Good:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request-promise";
import { writeFile } from "fs-extra";

async function getCleanCodeArticle() {
  try {
    const body = await get(
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin"
    );
    await writeFile("article.html", body);
    console.log("File written");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

getCleanCodeArticle()
```
