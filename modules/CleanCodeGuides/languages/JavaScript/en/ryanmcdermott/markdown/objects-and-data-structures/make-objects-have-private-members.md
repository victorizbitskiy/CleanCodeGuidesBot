## Objects and Data Structures

### Make objects have private members

This can be accomplished through closures \(for ES5 and below\).

**Bad:**

```javascript
const Employee = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};

Employee.prototype.getName = function getName() {
  return this.name;
};

const employee = new Employee("John Doe");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: undefined
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function makeEmployee(name) {
  return {
    getName() {
      return name;
    }
  };
}

const employee = makeEmployee("John Doe");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
```
