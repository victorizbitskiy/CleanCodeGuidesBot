### Don't have journal comments

Remember, use version control! There's no need for dead code, commented code,
and especially journal comments. Use `git log` to get history!  

**Bad:**

```javascript
/**
 * 2016-12-20: Removed monads, didn't understand them (RM)
 * 2016-10-01: Improved using special monads (JP)
 * 2016-02-03: Removed type-checking (LI)
 * 2015-03-14: Added combine with type-checking (JR)
 */
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
