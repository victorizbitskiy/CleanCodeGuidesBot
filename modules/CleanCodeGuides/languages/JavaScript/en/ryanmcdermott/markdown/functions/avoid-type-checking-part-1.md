## Functions

### Avoid type-checking \(part 1\)

JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.  

**Bad:**

```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
    vehicle.pedal(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  } else if (vehicle instanceof Car) {
    vehicle.drive(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  vehicle.move(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
}
```
