## **Functions**
### Avoid type-checking \(part 2\)
If you are working with basic primitive values like strings and integers,
and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check,
you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal
JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript
syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that
doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get
doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript clean, write
good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with
TypeScript \(which, like I said, is a great alternative!\).  

**Bad:**
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  if (
    (typeof val1 === "number" && typeof val2 === "number") ||
    (typeof val1 === "string" && typeof val2 === "string")
  ) {
    return val1 + val2;
  }

  throw new Error("Must be of type String or Number");
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  return val1 + val2;
}
```
