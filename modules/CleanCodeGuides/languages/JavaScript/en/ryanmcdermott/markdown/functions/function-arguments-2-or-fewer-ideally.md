## **Functions**
### Function arguments \(2 or fewer ideally\)  

Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.
One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.

Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.

To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

1. When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what
   properties are being used.
2. It can be used to simulate named parameters.
3. Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
   object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
   objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
   cloned.
4. Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
   without destructuring.  

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}
createMenu("Foo", "Bar", "Baz", true);
```

**Good:**
```javascript
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}
createMenu({
  title: "Foo",
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: "Baz",
  cancellable: true
});
```
