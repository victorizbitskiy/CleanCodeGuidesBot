## **Error Handling**
Thrown errors are a good thing! They mean the runtime has successfully
identified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting
you know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the
process \(in Node\), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.

### Don't ignore rejected promises
For the same reason you shouldn't ignore caught errors
from `try/catch`.  

**Bad:**
```javascript
getdata()
  .then(data => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

**Good:**
```javascript
getdata()
  .then(data => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // One option (more noisy than console.log):
    console.error(error);
    // Another option:
    notifyUserOfError(error);
    // Another option:
    reportErrorToService(error);
    // OR do all three!
  });
```
