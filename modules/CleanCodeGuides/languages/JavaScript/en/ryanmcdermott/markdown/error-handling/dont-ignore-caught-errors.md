## Error Handling

### Don't ignore caught errors

Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix
or react to said error. Logging the error to the console \(`console.log`\)
isn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed
to the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a `try/catch` it means you
think an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,
or create a code path, for when it occurs.  

**Bad:**

```javascript
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  // One option (more noisy than console.log):
  console.error(error);
  // Another option:
  notifyUserOfError(error);
  // Another option:
  reportErrorToService(error);
  // OR do all three!
}
```
