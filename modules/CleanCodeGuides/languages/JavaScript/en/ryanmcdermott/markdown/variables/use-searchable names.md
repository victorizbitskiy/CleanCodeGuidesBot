## **Variables**
### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.
**Bad:**
```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```
**Good:**
```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;
setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```
