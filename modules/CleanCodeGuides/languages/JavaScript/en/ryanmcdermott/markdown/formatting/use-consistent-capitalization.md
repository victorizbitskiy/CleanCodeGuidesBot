## **Formatting**

### Use consistent capitalization

JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.  

**Bad:**

```javascript
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const daysInMonth = 30;

const songs = ["Back In Black", "Stairway to Heaven", "Hey Jude"];
const Artists = ["ACDC", "Led Zeppelin", "The Beatles"];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restore_database() {}

class animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;

const SONGS = ["Back In Black", "Stairway to Heaven", "Hey Jude"];
const ARTISTS = ["ACDC", "Led Zeppelin", "The Beatles"];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restoreDatabase() {}

class Animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```
