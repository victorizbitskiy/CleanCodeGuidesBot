## Objects and Data Structures

### Make objects have private/protected members

* `public` methods and properties are most dangerous for changes, because some outside code may easily rely on them and you can't control what code relies on them. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all users of class.**
* `protected` modifier are as dangerous as public, because they are available in scope of any child class. This effectively means that difference between public and protected is only in access mechanism, but encapsulation guarantee remains the same. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all descendant classes.**
* `private` modifier guarantees that code is **dangerous to modify only in boundaries of single class** \(you are safe for modifications and you won't have [Jenga effect](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jengaphobia&defid=2494196)\).

Therefore, use `private` by default and `public/protected` when you need to provide access for external classes.

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    public $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
// Employee name: John Doe
echo 'Employee name: ' . $employee->name;
```

**Good:**

```php
class Employee
{
    private $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
// Employee name: John Doe
echo 'Employee name: ' . $employee->getName();
```
