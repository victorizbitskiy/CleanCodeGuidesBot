## Objects and Data Structures

### Use object encapsulation

In PHP you can set `public`, `protected` and `private` keywords for methods.
Using it, you can control properties modification on an object.

* When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
* Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
* Encapsulates the internal representation.
* Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
* Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality.
* You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.

Additionally, this is part of [Open/Closed](#openclosed-principle-ocp) principle.

**Bad:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    public $balance = 1000;
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->balance -= 100;
```

**Good:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    private $balance;

    public function __construct(int $balance = 1000)
    {
      $this->balance = $balance;
    }

    public function withdraw(int $amount): void
    {
        if ($amount > $this->balance) {
            throw new \Exception('Amount greater than available balance.');
        }

        $this->balance -= $amount;
    }

    public function deposit(int $amount): void
    {
        $this->balance += $amount;
    }

    public function getBalance(): int
    {
        return $this->balance;
    }
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->withdraw($shoesPrice);

// Get balance
$balance = $bankAccount->getBalance();
```
