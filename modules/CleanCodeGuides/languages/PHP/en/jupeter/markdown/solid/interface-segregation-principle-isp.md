## SOLID

### Interface Segregation Principle \(ISP\)

ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use."

A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to set up
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a "fat interface".

**Bad:**

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;

    public function eat(): void;
}

class HumanEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        // ...... eating in lunch break
    }
}

class RobotEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... robot can't eat, but it must implement this method
    }
}
```

**Good:**

Not every worker is an employee, but every employee is a worker.

```php
interface Workable
{
    public function work(): void;
}

interface Feedable
{
    public function eat(): void;
}

interface Employee extends Feedable, Workable
{
}

class HumanEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... eating in lunch break
    }
}

// robot can only work
class RobotEmployee implements Workable
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}
```
