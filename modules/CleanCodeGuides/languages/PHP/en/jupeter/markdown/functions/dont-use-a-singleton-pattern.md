## Functions

### Don't use a Singleton pattern

Singleton is an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Paraphrased from Brian Button:
 1. They are generally used as a **global instance**, why is that so bad? Because **you hide the dependencies** of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. Making something global to avoid passing it around is a [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).
 2. They violate the [single responsibility principle](#single-responsibility-principle-srp): by virtue of the fact that **they control their own creation and lifecycle**.
 3. They inherently cause code to be tightly [coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29). This makes faking them out under **test rather difficult** in many cases.
 4. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application. Another hit to testing since **you can end up with a situation where tests need to be ordered** which is a big no for unit tests. Why? Because each unit test should be independent from the other.

There is also very good thoughts by [Misko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/about/) about the [root of problem](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/25/root-cause-of-singletons/).

**Bad:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public static function getInstance(): self
    {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    // ...
}

$singleton = DBConnection::getInstance();
```

**Good:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    public function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Create instance of `DBConnection` class and configure it with [DSN](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php#refsect1-pdo.construct-parameters).

```php
$connection = new DBConnection($dsn);
```

And now you must use instance  of `DBConnection` in your application.
