## Functions

### Don't write to global functions  

Polluting globals is a bad practice in many languages because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an exception in
production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to have configuration array?
You could write global function like `config()`, but it could clash with another library
that tried to do the same thing.

**Bad:**

```php
function config(): array
{
    return [
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ];
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Configuration
{
    private $configuration = [];

    public function __construct(array $configuration)
    {
        $this->configuration = $configuration;
    }

    public function get(string $key): ?string
    {
        // null coalescing operator
        return $this->configuration[$key] ?? null;
    }
}
```

Load configuration and create instance of `Configuration` class

```php
$configuration = new Configuration([
    'foo' => 'bar',
]);
```

And now you must use instance of `Configuration` in your application.
