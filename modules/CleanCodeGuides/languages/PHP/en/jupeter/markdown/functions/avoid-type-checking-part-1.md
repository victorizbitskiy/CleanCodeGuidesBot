## Functions

### Avoid type-checking \(part 1\)

PHP is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.

**Bad:**

```php
function travelToTexas($vehicle): void
{
    if ($vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
        $vehicle->pedalTo(new Location('texas'));
    } elseif ($vehicle instanceof Car) {
        $vehicle->driveTo(new Location('texas'));
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function travelToTexas(Vehicle $vehicle): void
{
    $vehicle->travelTo(new Location('texas'));
}
```
