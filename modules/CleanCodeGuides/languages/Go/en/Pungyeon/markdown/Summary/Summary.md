## Summary

First of all, thank you for making it all the way through this article! I hope it has provided some insight into clean code and how it helps ensure maintainability, readability, and stability in any codebase.

Let's briefly sum up all the topics we've covered:

- _Functions_ - A function's name should reflect its scope; the smaller the scope of a function, the more specific its name. Ensure that all functions serve a single purpose in as few lines as possible. A good rule of thumb is to limit your functions to 5-8 lines and to only accept 2-3 arguments.

- _Variables_ - Unlike functions, variables should assume more generic names as their scope becomes smaller. It's also recommended that you limit the scope of a variable as much as possible to prevent unintentional modification. On a similar note, you should keep the modification of variables to a minimum; this becomes an especially important consideration as the scope of a variable grows.

- _Return Values_ - Concrete types should be returned whenever possible. Make it as difficult as possible for users of your package to make mistakes and as easy as possible for them to understand the values returned by your functions.

- _Pointers_ - Use pointers with caution, and limit their scope and mutability to an absolute minimum. Remember: Garbage collection only assists with memory management; it does not assist with all of the other complexities associated with pointers.

- _Interfaces_ - Use interfaces as much as possible to loosen the coupling of your code. Hide any code using the empty `interface{}` as much as possible from end users to prevent it from being exposed.

As a final note, it's worth mentioning that the notion of clean code is particularly subjective, and that likely won't ever change. However, much like my statement concerning `gofmt`, I think it's more important to find a common standard than something that everyone agrees with; the latter is extremely difficult to achieve.

It's also important to understand that fanaticism is never the goal with clean code. A codebase will most likely never be fully 'clean,' in the same way that your office desk probably isn't either. There's certainly room for you to step outside the rules and boundaries covered in this article. However, remember that the most important reason for writing clean code is to help yourself and other developers. We support engineers by ensuring stability in the software we produce and by making it easier to debug faulty code. We help our fellow developers by ensuring that our code is readable and easily digestible. We help *everyone* involved in the project by establishing a flexible codebase that allows us to quickly introduce new features without breaking our current platform. We move quickly by going slowly, and everyone is satisfied.

I hope you will join this discussion to help the Go community define \(and refine\) the concept of clean code. Let's establish a common ground so that we can improve software - not only for ourselves but for the sake of everyone.
