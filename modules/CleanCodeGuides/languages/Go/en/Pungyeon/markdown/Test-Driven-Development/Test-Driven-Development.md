### Test-Driven Development

Test-driven development is the practice of testing your code frequently throughout short development cycles or sprints. It ultimately contributes to code cleanliness by inviting developers to question the functionality and purpose of their code. To make testing easier, developers are encouraged to write short functions that only do one thing. For example, it's arguably much easier to test \(and understand\) a function that's only 4 lines long than one that's 40.

Test-driven development consists of the following cycle:

1. Write \(or execute\) a test
2. If the test fails, make it pass
3. Refactor your code accordingly
4. Repeat

Testing and refactoring are intertwined in this process. As you refactor your code to make it more understandable or maintainable, you need to test your changes thoroughly to ensure that you haven't altered the behavior of your functions. This can be incredibly useful as the codebase grows.
