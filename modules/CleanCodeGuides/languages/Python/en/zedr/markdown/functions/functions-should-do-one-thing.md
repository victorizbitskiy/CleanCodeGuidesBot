## Functions

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more
than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate
a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much
cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead
of many developers.
**Bad:**
```python
from typing import List
class Client:
    active: bool
def email(client: Client) -> None:
    pass
def email_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> None:
    """Filter active clients and send them an email.
    """
    for client in clients:
        if client.active:
            email(client)
```

**Good**:

```python
from typing import List


class Client:
    active: bool


def email(client: Client) -> None:
    pass


def get_active_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> List[Client]:
    """Filter active clients.
    """
    return [client for client in clients if client.active]


def email_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in get_active_clients(clients):
        email(client)
```

Do you see an opportunity for using generators now?

**Even better**

```python
from typing import Generator, Iterator


class Client:
    active: bool


def email(client: Client):
    pass


def active_clients(clients: Iterator[Client]) -> Generator[Client, None, None]:
    """Only active clients"""
    return (client for client in clients if client.active)


def email_client(clients: Iterator[Client]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in active_clients(clients):
        email(client)
```
