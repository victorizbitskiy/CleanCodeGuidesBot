## Functions

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction, your function is usually doing too
much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier testing.

**Bad:**

```python
# type: ignore

def parse_better_js_alternative(code: str) -> None:
    regexes = [
        # ...
    ]

    statements = code.split('\n')
    tokens = []
    for regex in regexes:
        for statement in statements:
            pass

    ast = []
    for token in tokens:
        pass

    for node in ast:
        pass
```

**Good:**

```python
from typing import Tuple, List, Dict


REGEXES: Tuple = (
   # ...
)


def parse_better_js_alternative(code: str) -> None:
    tokens: List = tokenize(code)
    syntax_tree: List = parse(tokens)

    for node in syntax_tree:
        pass


def tokenize(code: str) -> List:
    statements = code.split()
    tokens: List[Dict] = []
    for regex in REGEXES:
        for statement in statements:
            pass

    return tokens


def parse(tokens: List) -> List:
    syntax_tree: List[Dict] = []
    for token in tokens:
        pass

    return syntax_tree
```
