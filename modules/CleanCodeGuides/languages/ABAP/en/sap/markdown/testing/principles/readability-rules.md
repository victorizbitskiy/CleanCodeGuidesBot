#### Readability rules

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Principles] > [This section]

Make your test code even more readable than your productive code.
You can tackle bad productive code with good tests, but if you don't even get the tests, you're lost.

Keep your test code so simple and stupid that you will still understand it in a year from now.

Stick to standards and patterns, to enable your co-workers to quickly get into the code.
