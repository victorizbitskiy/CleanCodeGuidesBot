#### Name the code under test meaningfully, or default to CUT

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Code Under Test] > [This section]

Give the variable that represents the code under test a meaningful name:

```ABAP
DATA blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

Don't just repeat the class name with all its non-valuable namespaces and prefixes:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA clean_fra_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

If you have different test setups, it can be helpful to describe the object's varying state:

```ABAP
DATA empty_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
DATA simple_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
DATA very_long_blog_post TYPE REF TO ...
```

If you have problems finding a meaningful name, resort to `cut` as a default.
The abbreviation stands for "code under test".

```ABAP
DATA cut TYPE REF TO ...
```

Especially in unclean and confusing tests, calling the variable `cut`
can temporarily help the reader see what's actually tested.
However, tidying up the tests is the actual way to go for the long run.
