#### Few, focused assertions

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Assertions] > [This section]

Assert only exactly what the test method is about, and this with a small number of assertions.

```ABAP
METHOD rejects_invalid_input.
  " when
  DATA(is_valid) = cut->is_valid_input( 'SOME_RANDOM_ENTRY' ).
  " then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( is_valid ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

Asserting too much is an indicator that the method has no clear focus.
This couples productive and test code in too many places: changing a feature
will require rewriting a large number of tests although they are not really involved with the changed feature.
It also confuses the reader with a large variety of assertions,
obscuring the one important, distinguishing assertion among them.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD rejects_invalid_input.
  " when
  DATA(is_valid) = cut->is_valid_input( 'SOME_RANDOM_ENTRY' ).
  " then
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_false( is_valid ).
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_not_initial( log->get_messages( ) ).
  cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals( act = sy-langu
                                      exp = 'E' ).
ENDMETHOD.
```
