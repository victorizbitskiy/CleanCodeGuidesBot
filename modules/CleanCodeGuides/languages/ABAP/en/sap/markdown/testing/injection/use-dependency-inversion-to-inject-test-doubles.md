#### Use dependency inversion to inject test doubles

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Injection] > [This section]

Dependency inversion means that you hand over all dependencies to the constructor:

```ABAP
METHODS constructor
  IMPORTING
    customizing_reader TYPE REF TO if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader.

METHOD constructor.
  me->customizing_reader = customizing_reader.
ENDMETHOD.
```

Don't use setter injection.
It enables using the productive code in ways that are not intended:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHODS set_customizing_reader
  IMPORTING
    customizing_reader TYPE REF TO if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader.

METHOD do_something.
  object->set_customizing_reader( a ).
  object->set_customizing_reader( b ). " would you expect that somebody does this?
ENDMETHOD.
```

Don't use FRIENDS injection.
It will initialize productive dependencies before they are replaced, with probably unexpected consequences.
It will break as soon as you rename the internals.
It also circumvents initializations in the constructor.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
METHOD setup.
  cut = NEW fra_my_class( ). " <- builds a productive customizing_reader first - what will it break with that?
  cut->customizing_reader ?= cl_abap_testdouble=>create( 'if_fra_cust_obj_model_reader' ).
ENDMETHOD.

METHOD constructor.
  customizing_reader = fra_cust_obj_model_reader=>s_get_instance( ).
  customizing_reader->fill_buffer( ). " <- won't be called on your test double, so no chance to test this
ENDMETHOD.
```
