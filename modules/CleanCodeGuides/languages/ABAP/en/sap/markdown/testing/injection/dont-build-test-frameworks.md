#### Don't build test frameworks

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Injection] > [This section]

Unit tests - in contrast to integration tests - should be data-in-data-out, with all test data being defined on the fly as needed.

```ABAP
cl_abap_testdouble=>configure_call( test_double )->returning( data ).
```

Don't start building frameworks that distinguish "*test case IDs*" to decide what data to provide.
The resulting code will be so long and tangled that you won't be able to keep these tests alive in the long term.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern

test_double->set_test_case( 1 ).

CASE me->test_case.
  WHEN 1.
  WHEN 2.
ENDCASE.
```
