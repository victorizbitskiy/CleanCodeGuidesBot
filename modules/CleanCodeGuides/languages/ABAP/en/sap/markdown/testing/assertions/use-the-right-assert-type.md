#### Use the right assert type

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Assertions] > [This section]

```ABAP
cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals( act = table
                                    exp = test_data ).
```

Asserts often do more than meets the eye, for example `assert_equals`
includes type matching and providing precise descriptions if values differ.
Using the wrong, too-common asserts will force you into the debugger immediately
instead of allowing you to see what is wrong right from the error message.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_true( xsdbool( act = exp ) ).
```
