#### Exploit the test tools

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Injection] > [This section]

In general, a clean programming style
will let you do much of the work
with standard ABAP unit tests and test doubles.
However, there are tools that will allow you
to tackle trickier cases in elegant ways:

- Use the `CL_OSQL_REPLACE` service
to test complex OpenSQL statements
by redirecting them to a test data bin
that can be filled with test data
without interfering with the rest of the system.

- Use the CDS test framework to test your CDS views.
