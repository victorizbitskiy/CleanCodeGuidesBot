#### Don't misuse LOCAL FRIENDS to invade the tested code

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Testing] > [Injection] > [This section]

Unit tests that access private and protected members to insert mock data are fragile:
they break when the internal structure of the tested code changes.

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
CLASS /dirty/class_under_test DEFINITION LOCAL FRIENDS unit_tests.
CLASS unit_tests IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD returns_right_result.
    cut->some_private_member = 'AUNIT_DUMMY'.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
