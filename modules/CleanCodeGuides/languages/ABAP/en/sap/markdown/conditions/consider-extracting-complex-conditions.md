### Consider extracting complex conditions

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Conditions] > [This section]

It's nearly always a good idea to extract complex conditions to methods of their own:

```ABAP
IF is_provided( example ).

METHOD is_provided.
  DATA(is_filled) = xsdbool( example IS NOT INITIAL ).
  DATA(is_working) = xsdbool( applies( example ) = abap_true OR
                              fits( example ) = abap_true ).
  result = xsdbool( is_filled = abap_true AND
                    is_working = abap_true ).
ENDMETHOD.
```
