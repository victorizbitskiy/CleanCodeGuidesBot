### Consider decomposing complex conditions

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Conditions] > [This section]

Conditions can become easier when decomposing them into the elementary parts that make them up:

```ABAP
DATA(example_provided) = xsdbool( example_a IS NOT INITIAL OR
                                  example_b IS NOT INITIAL ).

DATA(one_example_fits) = xsdbool( applies( example_a ) = abap_true OR
                                  applies( example_b ) = abap_true OR
                                  fits( example_b ) = abap_true ).

IF example_provided = abap_true AND
   one_example_fits = abap_true.
```

instead of leaving everything in-place:

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
IF ( example_a IS NOT INITIAL OR
     example_b IS NOT INITIAL ) AND
   ( applies( example_a ) = abap_true OR
     applies( example_b ) = abap_true OR
     fits( example_b ) = abap_true ).
```
