### ABAP Doc only for public APIs

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Comments] > [This section]

Write ABAP Doc to document public APIs,
meaning APIs that are intended for developers
in other teams or applications.
Don't write ABAP Doc for internal stuff.

ABAP Doc suffers from the same weaknesses as all comments,
that is, it outdates quickly and then becomes misleading.
As a consequence, you should employ it only where it makes sense,
not enforce writing ABAP Doc for each and everything.
