```ABAP
METHOD do_something.
  " XXX FH delete this method - it does nothing
ENDMETHOD.
```

- `FIXME` points to errors that are too small or too much in-the-making for internal incidents.
- `TODO`s are places where you want to complete something in the near\(!\) future.
- `XXX` marks code that works but could be better.
