### Align assignments to the same object, but not to different ones

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Formatting] > [This section]

To highlight that these things somehow belong together

```ABAP
structure-type = 'A'.
structure-id   = '4711'.
```

or even better

```ABAP
structure = VALUE #( type = 'A'
                     id   = '4711' ).
```

But leave things ragged that have nothing to do with each other:

```ABAP
customizing_reader = fra_cust_obj_model_reader=>s_get_instance( ).
hdb_access = fra_hdbr_access=>s_get_instance( ).
```
