### Use the Pretty Printer before activating

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Formatting] > [This section]

Apply the pretty printer - Shift+F1 in SE80, SE24, and ADT - before activating an object.

If you modify a larger unformatted legacy code base,
you may want to apply the Pretty Printer only to selected lines
to avoid huge change lists and transport dependencies.
Consider pretty-printing the complete development object
in a separate Transport Request or Note.
