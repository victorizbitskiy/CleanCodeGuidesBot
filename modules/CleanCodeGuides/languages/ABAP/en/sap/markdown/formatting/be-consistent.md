### Be consistent

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [This section]

Format all code of a project in the same way.
Let all team members use the same formatting style.

If you edit foreign code, adhere to that project's formatting style
instead of insisting on your personal style.

If you change your formatting rules over time,
use [refactoring best practices]
to update your code over time.
