### Avoid noise words such as "data", "info", "object"

> [Clean ABAP] > [Content] > [Names] > [This section]

Omit noise words

```ABAP
account  " instead of account_data
alert    " instead of alert_object
```

or replace them with something specific that really adds value

```ABAP
user_preferences          " instead of user_info
response_time_in_seconds  " instead of response_time_variable
```
