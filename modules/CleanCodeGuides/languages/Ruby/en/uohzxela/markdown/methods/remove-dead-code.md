## **Methods**
### Remove dead code

Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in
your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe
in your version history if you still need it.

**Bad:**
```ruby
def old_request_module(url)
  # ...
end

def new_request_module(url)
  # ...
end

req = new_request_module(request_url)
inventory_tracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io')
```

**Good:**
```ruby
def new_request_module(url)
  # ...
end

req = new_request_module(request_url)
inventory_tracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io')
```
