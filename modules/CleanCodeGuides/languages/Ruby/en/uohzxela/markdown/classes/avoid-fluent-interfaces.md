### Avoid fluent interfaces

A [Fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) is an object
oriented API that aims to improve the readability of the source code by using
[method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining).

While there can be some contexts, frequently builder objects, where this
pattern reduces the verbosity of the code \(e.g., ActiveRecord queries\),
more often it comes at some costs:

1. Breaks [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29)
2. Breaks [Decorators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)
3. Is harder to [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) in a test suite
4. Makes diffs of commits harder to read

**Bad:**
```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(make, model, color)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @color = color
    # NOTE: Returning self for chaining
    self
  end

  def set_make(make)
    @make = make
    # NOTE: Returning self for chaining
    self
  end

  def set_model(model)
    @model = model
    # NOTE: Returning self for chaining
    self
  end

  def set_color(color)
    @color = color
    # NOTE: Returning self for chaining
    self
  end

  def save
    # save object...
    # NOTE: Returning self for chaining
    self
  end
end

car = Car.new('Ford','F-150','red')
  .set_color('pink')
  .save
```

**Good:**
```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :model, :color

  def initialize(make, model, color)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @color = color
  end

  def save
    # Save object...
  end
end

car = Car.new('Ford', 'F-150', 'red')
car.color = 'pink'
car.save
```
